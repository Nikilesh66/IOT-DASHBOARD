Real Time Health Monitoring System :

1.Introduction:
	Real Time Health Monitoring System  for Hospitals is an innovative solution aimed at improving the monitoring and care of general ward patients in hospitals. This project leverages advanced IoT technology to provide real-time health monitoring and automated alerting for patients. By ensuring continuous data collection and rapid communication, the system addresses the limitations of traditional health monitoring methods.

2.Features:
	->Continuous real-time monitoring of critical health parameters: heart rate, blood oxygen levels (SpO2), and body temperature.
	->Automated detection of abnormal health readings with threshold-based alerts.
	->Web-based dashboard for centralized monitoring of patient data.
	->Mobile app notifications for instant alerts to doctors and hospital authorities.
	->Personalized health tracking for trend analysis and historical data review.
	->Secure cloud storage and management of patient data.

3.Hardware Components:
	->ESP32 Microcontroller: For sensor data acquisition and wireless communication.
	->Heart Rate Sensor: To monitor the patientâ€™s pulse.
	->Pulse Oximeter (SpO2 Sensor): For measuring blood oxygen levels.
	->Temperature Sensor: To record body temperature.
	->Power Supply Unit: To ensure uninterrupted operation.

4.Software Components:
	*Firebase: Cloud platform for real-time database and analytics.
	*Arduino IDE: For programming the ESP32 microcontroller.
	*Web Dashboard: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time data visualization.
	*Mobile App: For instant notifications to hospital staff.
	*Python/Node.js Backend**: For data processing and alert triggering.

5.Objectives:
	*To enable real-time, continuous monitoring of general ward patients in hospitals.
	*To provide instant alerts for abnormal health conditions to hospital staff.
	*To centralize and personalize health data for better decision-making and care.

6.Proposed Methodology:

	1.Data Collection: Sensors capture health parameters and transmit them to an ESP32 microcontroller.
	2.Data Transmission: The ESP32 sends collected data to Firebase for real-time storage and processing.
	3.Data Analysis: Firebase analyzes the data based on predefined thresholds to identify anomalies.
	4.Alert System: Automated alerts are sent to the web dashboard and mobile apps with patient details such as bed number, name, and abnormal readings.
	5.Visualization: The web dashboard displays real-time data trends and history, enabling proactive care.


7.Advantages:
	*Automated and efficient monitoring reduces manual intervention.
	*Instant alerts minimize delays in critical care.
	*Scalability to monitor multiple patients simultaneously.
	*Secure and centralized patient data storage.
	*Historical data supports trend analysis and predictive insights

8.Conclusion:
Real Health Monitoring System for Hospitals provides a transformative approach to patient care in general wards by enabling continuous monitoring, instant alerts, and efficient data management. This system ensures improved response times, better resource allocation, and enhanced patient outcomes, setting a new standard for hospital health monitoring solutions.
